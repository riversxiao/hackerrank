## “An experience makes its appearance only when it is being said. And unless it is said it is, so to speak, non-existent.”
## One can’t say how life is, how chance or fate deals with people, except by telling the tale.
## “You are born alone. You die alone. The value of the space in between is trust and love,”
## It seizes points in common, between subjects having no very apparent connexion --Ada Lovelace

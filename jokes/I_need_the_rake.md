I was doing yard work after the storm this weekend and my wife was about to take a shower. I realized that I couldn’t find the rake. I yelled up to my wife, “Where’s the rake?”
She couldn’t hear me and she shouted back, “What?”
I pointed to my eye, then I pointed to my knee and made a raking motion. Then my wife wasn’t sure and said, “What?”.
I repeated the gestures: “EYE KNEE THE RAKE”.
My wife replied that she understands and signals back. She first points to her eye, next she points to her left breast, then she points to her bum, and finally to her crotch.
Well, there is no way in hell I could even come close to that one. Exasperated, I went upstairs and asked her, “What the hell was that?”
She replied, “EYE – LEFT TIT – BEHIND – THE BUSH”
